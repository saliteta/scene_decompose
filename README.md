# Hierachical Gaussian

## 1. Motivation and Problem Definition
- We want to have further understanding of current 3D representation
- Visual Place Recognition is a good start
- The definition would be the following: 
Input: 3D Representation and one or multiple 2D images
Output: Location in 3D representation, where those 2D images been taken


## 2. Preliminaries
- One need to have per Gaussian Features
- One can follow our pipeline here or do one's own
- We recommend to follow: https://splat-distiller.pages.dev/ to add your Gaussian Features. But we essentially just need a N,C tensor, where N is the number of Gaussian, and C is the number of channels

## 3. Instruction
### 3.1. Installation
- First Install Splat Feature Solver
- Then run:
```
pip install .
```

### 3.2 Train Gaussian: 
- Follow gsplat, train one's own Gaussian 

### 3.3 Lifting (Currently only support JAFAR hight dimensional dinov3 model)
```
python distill_wrapper.py -data.dir ${ur data dir contain colmap info} --distill.ckpt {trained Gaussian CKPT} --model.model-path {high dimensional dinov3 model pth}
```

### 3.4 Constructing Hierachical GS
```
python construct_hierachical_gs -c {ckpt path} -f {feature location} -o {output path}
```

### 3.5 Visualization
```
python hierachical_viewer.py -s {the output GS}
```

## 4. Stage I Results
### 4.1 Initial Gaussian and Initial Features
![Initial Splats and Features](assets/initial_result.png) The left handside is the initial 3DGS trained using the gsplat pipeline, and the right handside is the lifted features using Splat Feature Solver. The lifted features is JAFAR DINOV3 

### 4.2 Spatial Tree Construction
![Multi Layer Nodes and Gaussians](assets/spatial_node.png) Here is the reconstructed node that partition the Gaussian Splats into smaller and smaller region


### 4.3 Splate Moment Matching
![Multi Layer Nodes and Gaussians](assets/moment_matching.png) Here is the 3DGS moment matching. That is to say, for each higher level Gaussian, how we construct the Gaussian

### 4.4 Patchify Image Construction
![Multi Layer Nodes and Gaussians](assets/patchify_image.png) Here, we construct a patchified image feature to have cross attention with Gaussian Splats

### 4.5 Pipeline Output
![Quantitative Result](assets/quantitative.png) From Quantitative Result, we can see dramatically improvement
